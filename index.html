    <h1>Welcome.
You have entered the “Choose or Die” website.

Here, you will be forced to answer 100 questions.
There is no shortcut. There is no escape.

The rules are simple.
Press the Start button below to proceed.

Each page will present you with four choices.
Choose carefully.
Only one choice will allow you to move forward.

A wrong decision, or any attempt to abandon the process midway, will result in consequences.
Those consequences will be irreversible, and the responsibility will be entirely yours.

Once all 100 questions have been answered, a final page will appear.
There, you will find a message… and a button.

Press it, and you may leave this site.

Fail, and you will not.

Good luck.
You will need it.</h1>
